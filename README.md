### Or in plain English.

My name is Morgan Jones, and I go by He/Him pronouns. I can speak English fluently, and I'm learning Welsh and Japanese. In high school, my GCSE options are Information Technology, Religious Studies and Public Services (Level 2).

I dual boot both Windows 11 and Arch Linux (with Hyprland as my window manager). My linux shell is `zsh` and my code editor is Visual Studio Code.

I primarily code in JavaScript and TypeScript, but I also use bash, Rust or Python (**very** occasionally).

My computer runs on a Ryzen 5 3400G and an AMD RX 6650 XT by MSI, on an Asrock B450m Pro4 motherboard, a EVGA 500W power supply, an Addlink 256GB NVMe SSD for boot, a WD Blue 1TB M.2 SSD for storage and 2 Corsair Vengance LPX 8GB DDR4 memory sticks.
